# howstat

Web scrapping on howstat website(cricket statistics) for any number of players and plotting the retrieved information in a histogram using python modules.

howstat is a website which is maintained by some diehard cricket freaks. It contains statistics about various games,
players.

using the scripts in this project we can pull data from website.
parse it and use it according to our requirements.
visualise that data.

I used python3 for writing scripts.

modules used:
1) urrlib for requesting and retrieving data from howstat server.
2) beautifulSoup for parsing the HTML data from server and extracting useful data.
3) matplotlib for plotting and visualising the extracted data.

i used two players,
Virat Kohli
Steven peter deveraux Smith.

for comparision.
the screenshots are obtained after running the scripts.
